# CS226R-Final-Project
Extending Debiasing Algorithms to Eliminate Indirect Bias in Gender-Neutral Embedding Geometry. 

"Baseline_Classifiers.ipynb" contains our code for experiments on the IMDB downstream classification task. 

"Data Preprocessing w_ Embeddings.ipynb" contains code for pre-processing the IMDB dataset using the word embeddings dataset. 

"New Algorithm.ipynb" contains code for our modified algorithm implementation. 

"Old Algorithm.ipynb" contains code for the algorithm implementation (taken from https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe/tree/master). 

The CSV files contain pre-processed IMDB datasets using the three embedding datasets. 

Note that much of the debiasing algorithm code in "New Algorithm.ipynb" is based off of code for the original algorithm here: https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe/tree/master.
